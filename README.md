# Emotify Webapp

I love listening to music, and one of my favourite things to do is make emotion-themed playlists. Imagine my surprise when I discovered Spotify's API has emotional scores for each song in its database!

Thus, I developed this webapp. the webapp uses JavaScript, React, and HTML/CSS to me generate playlists that fit the user's current mood. Makes use of the Spotify API, its built-in emotional sentiment scores, and its access to user library info (with consent) to generate playlists from a user's library.

Now, users can interact with the React UI elements, log into their Spotify accounts, select their desired mood from the dropdown menu, and create a playlist themed off their current emotion. Just like that!

One of the biggest learning outcomes of this project was developing my front and back end development skills. I learned to style objects using CSS, create interactive elements with React, and communicate information on the back end with Spotify's API using JavaScript.
